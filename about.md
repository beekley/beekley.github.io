I write code. Mostly for work. Sometimes just for fun. I also brew beer and dungeon-master D&D (is that a verb?). I am [strangely nostalgic for malls](https://www.reddit.com/r/VaporwaveAesthetics/) and hope to make a game someday.

Message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brettbeekley/) (for Professional Business) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jackdriper) (otherwise). I promise I'll at least read it.
