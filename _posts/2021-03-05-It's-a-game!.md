I enjoy games and, like many similar games-enjoyers, I want to make my own. I've started and stopped working on at least 5 different game projects over the past decade. I'm happy [1] to say that today I've "finished" one.

You can [play it here](https://storage.googleapis.com/public-build/exports/web.html)!

Warning: It's not very fun. That may change if/when I continue to work on it. I have [big plans for it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tu0XAV4NPk6wzpbwJ_6ZEYqc-_Zla56A6bKae36KPuM/edit?usp=sharing), but I realized that increasing the scope was not actually making me want to keep contributing. I'll likely build something new first (maybe at a game jam!), since I still love the idea of making games.

[1] Not happy because it's good. But because it's a relief to no longer have 0 completed projects hanging over me.
