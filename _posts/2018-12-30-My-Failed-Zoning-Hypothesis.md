Failed is a strong word and possibly inappropriate here. "Unproven, yet," may be better.

There's a lot of talk in CA about housing and about making zoning changes to address its high expense and low availability. It can sometimes feel like the discussion focuses on [current renters and hopeful first-time buyers](https://cayimby.org/) supporting upzoning, while [existing single-family homeowners](https://www.lewis.ucla.edu/opposition-to-new-housing/) oppose and would be harmed by it. I fall into the former category, but believe that there is a financial benefit from upzoning to existing homeowners that isn't talked about much. My hypothesis:

Increasing the options of what can be built on a property (e.g. through relaxed zoning) increases the property's value.

It feels intuitive. If you have two identical assets, but you are legally allowed to do an additional thing with one of them, the "free-er" one is more valuable. I first tested this hypothesis by comparing the values of the apartment property I lived in and the single-family home next door. This should control variables: both were corner properties of similar size on the same block of the same neighborhood. One was zoned R3 (multi-unit) and the other R1 (single-family residence).

From Redfin (lightly rounded):

| Property | Parcel Size (sqft) | Value (million $) | Value ($/sqft)| Value, without building ($/sqft)|
|----------|--------------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------------------|
| R3       | 11750              | 11.0              |  936          | 527                             |
| R1       | 7150               | 2.8               |  391          | 289                             |

Each square foot of lot of the R3 property is worth 2.4x the R1 property next door. However, this ignores the value/cost of the building itself, [which may be around $200/sqft in LA](https://www.biggerpockets.com/forums/24/topics/160796-new-construction-costs-for-apartment-buildings-in-la-county). When we subtract the cost to build the building, the increase becomes about 1.8x. Still a huge gain just for being zoned higher.
