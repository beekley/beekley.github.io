![Who speaks per episode](https://github.com/beekley/beekley.github.io/blob/master/images/2019-01-24.png?raw=true)

I just finished listening to the first major campaign of The Adventure Zone, a podcast where three brothers and their dad play Dungeons and Dragons. It's very good! Each arc definitely felt pretty different, especially the last arcs (especially especially The Stolen Century) seemed to have a lot of exposition by the DM and little action by the players. So I set out to see if there were any trends for how much players spoke each arc/episode.

blah blah
